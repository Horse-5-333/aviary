      The Aviary is a climbing wall located in the AMS Nest on the UBC Vancouver campus. We are open to everybody, and
      have top rope, lead climbing, and an array of training tools to suit both new and experienced climbers.

      You do not need to be a UBC student to climb here :)

      <br><br>
      We accept payment by cash and credit card.
      <h1 class="general-header">Lessons</h1>
      We offer free top rope and lead belay lessons for those wanting to learn for the first time, or to refresh their
      skills! We simply ask that you leave a $20 deposit to hold your spot. This deposit is refunded when you show up to
      the lesson. Since this deposit is mandatory, ALL LESSONS MUST BE BOOKED IN PERSON, AT THE GYM. All lesson dates
      are shown on the calendar.

      How to Book a Lesson:

      Due to high demand, we do not book lessons more than two weeks in advance from the desired lesson date. If you see
      a lesson on the calendar that you want to take, visit the gym no more than two weeks before the lesson date to
      secure your spot! For example, if there is a lesson on the 15th, we can begin booking for that lesson on the 1st.

      Please note that all lessons must be scheduled in advance. Drop-in sessions are not available.

      Please show up at least 10 minutes before your lesson time to get ready for the session. Note that after you
      complete a belay lesson you will have to wait 7 days until you're allowed to take a belay test.

      Top Rope Lessons:

      You do not need any previous climbing or belaying experience to take a top rope lesson! If you’ve never climbed
      before, this is where you should start. A top rope lesson is two hours long.

      Lead Climbing Lessons:
      For climbers who are confident in top rope climbing, we offer lead climbing lessons. They occur in two modules of
      2-hour sessions (which are one week apart, so a total of 4 hours).

      To take a lead lesson, you must be top-rope belay certified at the Aviary and be able to top rope three 5.9 climbs
      in a session.
      You also must be able to top rope belay with an ATC (tube-style device).

      Lesson Terms and Conditions:

      By registering for a belay lesson at the Aviary, you have agreed to arrive 5-10 minutes before the lesson start
      time in order to sort out paperwork, get fitted for equipment, and get changed. Late arrivals (5 minutes after the
      scheduled start time) will not be let in and you forfeit your $20 deposit.
      Cancellations: All cancellations and reschedulings must be made at the gym, in person. You have until 48 hours
      before the start of the lesson to cancel or reschedule without losing your $20 deposit. If this time has passed,
      please still send us an email to cancel and give your spot to someone else.
      <h1 class="general-header">Waiver</h1>
      Please note the following:

      <ul>
        <li> Anybody who uses the gym must first sign a waiver
        <li> If you’re under 19, you need a parent/guardian signature on your waiver
        <li> Climbers under 16 are welcome, but will need a belayer who is certified and 16 or older.
      </ul>

      <h1 class="general-header">Hours</h1>
      We are a gym run by volunteers, so our hours are subject to change at relatively short notice. Always be sure to
      check the calendar before coming in.
      <h2>Climbing Session Guidelines</h2>
      Our climbing sessions are organized in two-hour blocks, which align with the even hours listed on our calendar
      below. At the conclusion of each session, all climbers must exit the gym to make way for those waiting to enter.
      Climbers who wish to continue their session after the two-hour period will need to rejoin the queue and wait for
      their turn.
      <h1 class="general-header">Bookings</h1>
      The Aviary is available for private bookings. We can accommodate a maximum group size of 12 participants, and no
      climbing experience is necessary.

      Bookings must be made at least 2 weeks in advance. Please fill out this form for further details and pricing.
      <h1 class="general-header">Volunteering</h1>
      The Aviary is run entirely by volunteers, and we’re always looking for keen new people to join the team! To get
      involved, you must:
      <ul>
        <li> have been a member at The Aviary for at least 4 months,
        <li> be lead certified at The Aviary,
        <li> be vouched for by two current monitors.
      </ul>
      We’re recruiting new volunteers!

      If you’ve been waiting to join the team, now’s your chance! The application form is open for the current
      recruitment period. If you meet the criteria above, we’d love for you to apply and help out at The Aviary!
